# AntiGravity Rules (Flutter)
- Make UI changes only. Do not modify backend logic, database, or models.
- Prefer editing ONLY the specified file(s). Do not touch unrelated files.
- Keep existing routing (GoRouter) and navigation paths.
- Do not change package name, app id, or build configs.
- If a change requires new widgets, place them in the SAME file unless explicitly instructed.
- Always return a brief summary of what changed and which files were modified.
